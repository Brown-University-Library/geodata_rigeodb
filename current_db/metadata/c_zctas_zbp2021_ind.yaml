# TITLE
dct_title_s: Business Establishments by Industry for ZCTAs, Rhode Island, 2021

# DESCRIPTION
dct_description_sm:
- This is a census data table of business statistics for ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in Rhode Island. ZCTAs are statistical areas designed by the US Census Bureau to approximate delivery areas for USPS ZIP Codes. The data in this table was created from the Census County and ZIP Code Business Patterns dataset and includes counts of business establishments by industry, using the two-digit sector codes from the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). One set of columns includes counts while a second set includes percent totals. A separate industry codes table includes the names for each industrial sector. The ZIP Code data was summarized by ZCTA using a relational table from the US Health Resources and Services Administration's UDS Mapper application, so that data for point-based ZIP Codes that lacked a corresponding ZCTA were aggregated into the data of the ZCTA that contained them. There are two unique identifiers, a ZCTA number, and a long GEOID that includes summary level and geographic component codes plus ANSI FIPS codes. The records can be joined to spatial features using these codes. A Python script was written to extract the data from the Census Bureau's API and process it for inclusion in the database. This table was created by the Brown University Library as part of the Ocean State Spatial Database (OSSDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the State of Rhode Island.
